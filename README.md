## Connecting to the proxy

If you are building a Docker image on the DogeData network, you will need to connect to a proxy. The packer build is looking for the following environment variables to be set:

```bash
export DOGE_PROXY_UNAME='domain\your%20username'
export DOGE_PROXY_PASSWORD='your%20password'
export DOGE_PROXY_HOST='l02piproxy01.corp.local'
export DOGE_PROXY_PORT='80'
```
