# doge-application
The Front-end application of Doge Life.

## Connecting to the proxy 

If you are building a Docker image on the DogeData network, you will need to connect to a proxy. The packer build is looking for the following environment variables to be set: 

```bash
export DOGE_PROXY_UNAME='LTDTOO\your%20username'
export DOGE_PROXY_PASSWORD='your%20password'
export DOGE_PROXY_HOST='l02piproxy01.corp.local'
export DOGE_PROXY_PORT='80'
```
